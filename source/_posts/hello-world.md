For those who don't know Bayo, in a nutshell, we provide a travel social network, you can give a [try](https://bayo.vn) here.

Beside of everyday job at Bayo, we decide to have something new, an engineering blog, and you're reading the first post of it.

## But why?

We are running a great platform, we have some interesting toy projects, and we just want to share it open to the world (soon enough).

We all understand that big things start with small beginnings. We just took off, and look for an interesting journey ahead.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
